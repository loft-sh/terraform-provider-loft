## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Standard SpaceInstance's metadata. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))
- `spec` (Block List, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--spec))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this resource. The format is `<namespace>/<name>`.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `namespace` (String) Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) An unstructured key value map stored with the SpaceInstance that may be used to store arbitrary metadata. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
- `generate_name` (String) Prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the `name` field has not been provided. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. Read more: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) the SpaceInstance. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
- `name` (String) Name of the SpaceInstance, must be unique. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

Read-Only:

- `generation` (Number) A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this SpaceInstance that can be used by clients to determine when SpaceInstance has changed. Read more: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) The unique in time and space value for this SpaceInstance. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
# import the `example-space`, located in the `loft-p-example-project` namespace into the `loft_space_instance.example-space` resource
terraform import loft_space_instance.example-space loft-p-example-project/example-space
```
